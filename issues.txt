    VIEW SELECTOR?
    -update value whenever view table is generated

    DATA MODAL
    - if hash selected and entry is object => change from string to obj
    - display is still funky (possibly fixed 11/3)

    CLEAN UP UNUSED OR COMMENTED OUT CODE
    REFACTOR

11/3

    INDEX COL -> DROPDOWN
    -multiple columns if in hash view and entry is an array

    MAKE RELOAD BUTTON?

** SUBMIT BUTTON APPEARS WHEN BEFORE KEY IS SELECTED

RESOLVED ISSUES
10/26

    *EXPAND DATA INPUT
    - some data is stringified but propbably shouldn't be

    INDEX COL DROPDOWN
    - objects not displayed correctly --> only dispaly as column if collision (obj.val && obj.next)

    **LIST VIEW & URL INPUT
    - when going backward through list data, does not produce a table

    ** VIEWTYPE DROPDOWN
    - reverts back to original data when choosing between "hash" and "list"

    ***URL INPUT BAR
    - arrows/buttons are removed out of order

    * DATA COL -> BUCKET -> DROPDOWN
    - remove if hash and only one value


10/27

    SPINNER
    - appears when final URL BUTTON removed

    SUBMIT BUTTON
    - submit button needs to be removed after returning to original state

    *SUBMIT FUNCTION & DATA
    - need to determine if proper data will be saved after going backward and forward through json data

    COLLISION TABLE
    - how does it collect data when moving through JSON data?


11/2
    DATA FIELD
    - onclick if not object, modal still appears

    VIEW SELECTOR
    - when reversing through json (closing buttons in URL bar), view selector does not change

11/3
    VIEW SELECTOR
    - when removing buttons out of order, does not remove "next" buttons/arrows

    **SUBMIT BUTTON
    - submit button also appears when retrieving from database
